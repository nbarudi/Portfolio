I realized that my original method of just giving people a Github profile without a Profile ReadMe was not the best way to handle job applications. But this website was a lot of fun to design and I am happy with the way it turned out. I took a lot of inspiration from DaniDipps portfolio but still did my best to add my own little twists on the design. The website was designed using Vue Components as a base and then dynamically built through reading a set few Json files to allow for quick editing and additions to the portfolio. <br/> The website was then placed onto a dedicated server into a Kubernetes based Docker Environment to keep it running constantly, even between updates! <br/>I had also made use of Githubs CICD platform to automatically build and upload the website to the server",

This mainly consisted of creating Packet Code to allow for more advanced content like Player Clones or Player Nicknames. There are a few videos in this list. <br /> The first showcasing the player clones shows how I had set up tracking for the clones to follow a Block Display. This allowed the team to move the player clones without needing to keep track of their exact location. This also opened the ability of using the Bukkit API to move the clones instead of Packets <br/> The second video showcases the ability for players to change their display name. This feature changes the players GameProfile on the server side meaning there is no need to update it in the event a player disconnects as the server will take care of it. This also means the Player List and Commands all interact with the displayed users name, not their original, although the original is still an option. <br/> The third video shows an Animated PasteSpell. Although I did not build the original animation, I had setup the ability for the Spell to undo a schematic using the animation. As well I discovered an error with large schematics causing Stack Overflows and implemented a fix to allow the builds to complete.",

The Server also had a UI element which allowed who ever owned it to moderate the server which gave them the ability to, mute, kick, and ban users where they saw fit.",

It was based on a version of the Mini-Game created back in 2012 using the MagicSpells plugin. The Re-Creation was developed from scratch and went through 3 different iterations. <br /><br />The first was based 100% in MagicSpells. This version was 100% true to the original, but the game was very laggy and difficult to add new content to. <br /><br />Thus the second version was generally split half and half between a custom plugin and MagicSpells. This version was a lot of fun to play but was still missing the expandability that I knew was possible. <br /><br />The final revision was built from the ground up using a custom Spigot Plugin for Minecraft 1.12.2. This version of the game ran for around 1 year before the project was abandoned due to lack of interest from the community. <br /><br />On average the event would get 20-30 members each game. Games were run once a week and streamed on Twitch.",

I had created it with the goal of both giving players a limited number of lives, which would re-charge after 1 day if all were lost, and also giving a Skill Shop to players. This project was the first major system I had created in Minecraft so it was designed very simply but it was loads of fun to play with the community it had. There were around 10-20 consistant players on the server when it was active, it was eventually shut down due to loss of interest. The plugin made use of a Points System where players could gain points by completing Achievements in game. Points were awarded based on the difficulty of the achievement. They could then be spent on Skill Upgrades in a skill shop containing flight, auto smelting, spell, regeneration, and many other perks. As well these points could be used to buy more lives if the player ever got too low. In-Case the player had Skill Points but lost all their lives I had created a Discord Bot which Linked to the server. This lead me to creating a Key System to allow for a link between discord & minecraft accounts.",
